    <h4>Recipe instructions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat a grill or a skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
      <li>
        In a mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, salt, and pepper. Mix well
        and form into four equal-sized patties.
      </li>
      <li>Lightly brush the patties with olive oil on both sides.</li>
      <li>
        Grill or cook the patties on a skillet for about 3-4 minutes on each
        side, or until they are cooked through to your liking.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the patties are cooking, fry the bacon in a separate pan until
        crispy.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, Sriracha sauce, and
        honey until smooth. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the patties are cooked, place a slice of cheddar cheese on top of
        each patty and let it melt for a minute.
      </li>
      <li>Toast the burger buns until lightly browned.</li>
      <li>
        To assemble the burgers, spread the sauce on the bottom bun, place the
        lettuce, tomato, and onion on top, followed by the patty with melted
        cheese, two slices of bacon, and the top bun.
